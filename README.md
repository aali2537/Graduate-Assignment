# Graduate Assignment
## Option 1: Create a Practice Set
 
### Practice Set: Express routing and middleware
Students will be provided base code that contains a simple node web server that has two pages, /home and /login. Students are tasked with creating custom express middleware that will:
1. Redirect to the login page if no user login is detected in session
2. Authenticate users from the login page (An array of username and passwords will be provided inside of local storage)

The main goal of this excercise is to test a student's ability to be able to develop their own custom middleware, as well as their overall knowledge of the express framework being able to pull data from requests and deal with routing.
